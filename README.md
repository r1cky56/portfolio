I'm a passionate and curious learner, driven by a deep interest in understanding systems, solving problems, and creating meaningful impact through my skills. Whether it’s through coding, design, or critical thinking, I strive to bring clarity, purpose, and precision to everything I work on. My portfolio is a reflection of my journey — one built on consistency, curiosity, and a mindset that values growth over shortcuts.
